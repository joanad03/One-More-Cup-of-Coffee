1. Introduction
This file is for providing a quick documentation on the assets and how to use it. It's a brief introduction and doesn't provide an overall guidance on how to import e.t.c. We assumed you already know a little thing or two about Unity.

2. Content
The model only include a fan model. To have an overall view, kindly visit the prefab scene. The prefab is also very useful when importing. You can perform some basic operations on your prefabs. 
Note that the prefab include a model and a material that we'll talk about next. 

2.1 The model
The model consist of a 3D Model of a Fan. Properly aligned and scale. But it is highly advisable to edit the transformation of the object to suit your needs. 

2.2 The material
The material is applied to the model using shaders and we expect you to be able to change color of a shader material easily which allows the easiest possible way to change the color of parts of the fan model. If you have no idea of how materials work, a quick 5-10 minutes of a Youtube tutorial will be amazingly helpful in your unity journey.

3. About and License
Files include .fbx file with editable materials. 
Note: The format of editing is up to you as the model is highly editable. The choice of license is the same as that from the unity asset store.
